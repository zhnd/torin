/**
 * Fetch the cached repo-navigation snapshot for a project — the output
 * of the most-recent COMPLETED analyze-repository task's ANALYSIS stage
 * event. Threaded into the analyze-defect prompt as a navigation hint
 * on large monorepos.
 *
 * Returns null when no analyze-repository has ever succeeded for this
 * project; the analyze-defect agent then falls back to pure on-demand
 * exploration.
 *
 * Lives in workflow (not server) because:
 *   - It is workflow execution context, not a server-API concern
 *     (`apps/server/CLAUDE.md`: "thin API layer, all execution via
 *     workflow").
 *   - Activities are the determinism boundary — workflow code stays
 *     deterministic, IO happens here.
 *   - Querying at workflow-execution time picks up any
 *     analyze-repository that landed BETWEEN task creation and
 *     workflow start (the server-side variant would have snapshotted
 *     a stale view).
 *   - Keeps `ResolveDefectInput` lean — no 2-3 KB AnalysisResult
 *     riding in the Temporal workflow payload.
