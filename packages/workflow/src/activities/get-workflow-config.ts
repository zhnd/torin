/**
 * Reads workflow-level feature flags from the worker's environment.

 * sandbox with no access to `process.env`; activities run in the
 * worker's normal Node process and can read env freely.
 *
 * Add new flags here rather than scattering env reads across multiple
 * activities — one well-known call site keeps the flag surface audit-
 * able and the workflow gets one canonical snapshot per run.
