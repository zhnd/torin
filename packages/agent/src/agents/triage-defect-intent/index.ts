/**
 * Triage agent — parses a raw defect description into a structured
 * DefectIntent. Text-only: no sandbox, no file access, no shell. The
 * Claude Agent SDK's built-in tools (Bash/Read/Grep/etc.) are not
 * whitelisted because we pass no `allowedTools`; only the
 * auto-registered `submit_result` tool is callable, which is the
 * one we want.
 *
 * Output is consumed by the analyze-defect agent as a constraint
 * (SpecRover-style spec-as-shared-artifact pattern), specifically:
 *   - searchHypotheses are the analyze agent's first-turn agenda
 *   - keyTerms (bilingual) drive grep targets without losing Chinese
 *   - unknowns surface "ask the human" questions to the HITL gate
 *
 * Designed to be cheap (~6 turns, no tool round-trips). If you have
 * AGENT_MAX_TURNS_TRIAGE_DEFECT_INTENT set in env, it overrides.
